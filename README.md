# project-logs README

This is the README for your extension "project-logs-2". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## What is it for?

Well, imagine you have a project, and you need to edit/add new features.
And you only need these new files.
With this extension, as soon as you add/change a file, it will be saved in a secondary folder with the same directories, so you will only have your new files/modified files there.

Command to start: Start Logs
