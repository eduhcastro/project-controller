# Project Controller

## Overview

An extension for Visual Studio. Have full control of your projects, editing/creating new files. This extension was created for you, the developer, to have more control and autonomy in your most complex projects, in which you will be aware of which files have been modified.

### How it works?
After you edit/add a new file, a folder will be created with the name (project-controller-date) and inside it will be copied all the new/modified files with their subfolders.

### Observe
* Deleted files have no effect

### Project View
